# Transcription and QA based on video
Scripts designed to download video based on the URL and transcribe the video using a LLM audio-to-text transcription model to be defined. 
The transcribed text is then used to generate questions and answers using a LLM to be defined - probably ChatGPT. 
The QA model is then used to answer questions based on the video content.
